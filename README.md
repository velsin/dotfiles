# Dotfile sync repo

This repo structure is designed to be synced with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a symlink farm manager. Just download the repository and run `stow <FOLDER_NAME>/` to sync the config from that folder. You can also run `stow */` to sync everything, but some of the configs are currently deprecated and not set up with the correct folder structure to be synced with `stow`.
